You are given a tree which consists of N nodes and each node has a monster living in it. You are given an array A where the strength of the ith monster is given by A[i]

You are also given an array P where the parent of node U is given by P[U].

A connected component is considered good if no monster in this component can eat all other monsters in the same component.

It is given that a monster i can eat another monster jif

• Both of them live in the same connected component.

• The strength of the Ith monster is greater than the jth monster. After that, the strength of the Ith monster increases by the strength of the jth one

Find the maximum possible size of a good connected component

Note:

• It is given that P[1] is equal to 0

Input Format

The first line contains an integer. N. denoting the number of elements in P

Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 1 s is N) contains an integer describing Plil
